3. Create service registry endpoints
4. Build basic authentication
5. Deploy to staging

### Phase 2: x402 Core (Weeks 5-8)
1. Implement x402 protocol handler
2. Integrate Solana wallet connection

2. Implement service listing flow
3. Create analytics views
4. Add API key management
5. Test end-to-end provider experience

### Phase 4: Agent Integration (Weeks 13-16)

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

### Week 1 Priorities:
1. **Set up backend repository** - Choose stack (Node.js recommended)
2. **Design database schema** - Services, Users, Transactions, Analytics
3. **Create API endpoints** - Start with `/services` GET endpoints
4. **Deploy MVP backend** - Get frontend talking to real data
5. **Test with real services** - Add 3-5 real API services

### Critical Decisions Needed:
- Backend framework choice (Express, Fastify, Next.js API routes?)
- Database choice (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase?)
- Hosting platform (Railway, Render, AWS, Vercel?)
- Payment processing approach (direct Solana or middleware?)
- SDK-first or API-first approach?

## Summary

**Frontend Progress: 90% Complete** ‚úÖ
- Beautiful, functional UI
- Clean architecture
- Ready for real data

**Backend Progress: 0% Complete** ‚ùå
- Everything still to build
- API, database, payment processing
- Core x402 protocol implementation

**Overall Project: ~15% Complete**

The foundation is solid, but the real work (backend, blockchain integration, payment processing) is still ahead. The good news: you have a production-ready frontend that can plug into a backend as soon as it's built.
